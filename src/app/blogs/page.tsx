        <p className='text-[18px] capitalize font-light mx-40 my-10'>Hello friends, it’s surely been a while! A lot has happened since I’ve last written a post: my travel style changed, I began learning Spanish, got a new tattoo, started to drive more often, filled my house with plants, saw Taylor Swift live in concert, and above all, visited some amazing destinations that I didn’t think it would be possible before the pandemic. However, there was one trip that I had planned for 2020 and I’ve been trying to make it happen ever since: the trip to New York. It finally became a reality this year and, as I would find out, it happened at the right time.</p>
        <p className='text-[18px] capitalize font-light mx-40 my-10'>Let me walk you through a little back story. Around the end of 2019 we were discussing about traveling to New York, I remember we were in Milan, a few days before New Year’s Eve, and we kept seeing ads in the subway for visiting New York. We made an itinerary and bought the plane tickets in January 2020 for June, booked hotels and even tickets to a Broadway play and a music festival. Then in March, the world had shut down for a while. Naively, I would think that it will be over quickly, but it obviously didn’t so the flights were canceled, we received a voucher and a year later, we would book flight tickets for September 2021. Surprise again, USA still hadn’t lifted the travel ban so voucher it was again.</p>
